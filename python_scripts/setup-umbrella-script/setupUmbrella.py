"""
Take a file containing frame number vs. distance, then identify frames that
sample those distances at approximately sample_interval.  Optionally takes an
arbitrary number of template files.  The program searches the contents of these
files for a search string (by default XXX), replaces the search string with the
frame number, then writes out each file with a unique, frame-specific filename.
This last feature means that this script can be used to automatically generate
input files to run each umbrella sampling simulation.

v. 0.1: fixed bug where the script would choke on distance_files that went by
        frame intervals besides steps of 1.
